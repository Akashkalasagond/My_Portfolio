                <h2>Alzheimer Dementia Classification and Detection</h2><br>
                <p>In my Machine Learning project, I did Alzheimer's Dementia Classification. Labeled brain images undergo preprocessing, featuring normalization and resizing. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhances image recognition. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes learning rates for performance. The dataset is split for training and testing, preventing overfitting. Model evaluation includes metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. Post-training, the model is deployed on Streamlit for scalability, enabling it to analyze new images and provide diagnostic outcomes. This streamlined process also facilitates data collection, amplifying the project's impact.</p>
